# Chameleon Creator Code Challenge Ruby on Rails 

This is a ruby on rails code challenge. It is a simple todo application. 

## Installation

standard rails using 6.0.2.1. Make sure you have node >= 10 installed to run webpack which is needed from 
the front end.

---

it uses the basic rails new with webpack=react and a couple of front end library and devise for auth.

The challenge involves 2 parts, a quick read and understand and a small amount of coding. We are looking 
to see how well you can understand and work with rails, and also how you think about what you are doing.

## Part 1. 

Spend 10 - 15 mins (short) and read through the app and get an understanding of what is going on. 

Jot down 2 - 3 points that you like about it, or has been done well, and why

Jot down 2 - 3 points about what you would do to make the app better without adding any new features and why. 

## Part 2. 

Fork the repo and create a new branch. 

Implement 1 or more feature of your choice. Don't spend more than hour or so on it, 
just enough so that you think you have showed us what you can do. 

some suggestions include

- enable the ability to delete a todo
- create an admin user that can see all users todos 
- provide a search capability todo's

but you can do whatever you think provides value. 

You can submit a question as an issue on the github

once you have finished, submit a pull request.
