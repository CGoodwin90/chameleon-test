# Chameleon Creator Code Challenge Ruby on Rails 

This is a ruby on rails code challenge. It is a simple todo application. 

Its is intentionally made to be rough, and there are two parts to the challenge

## Part 1. 

Spend 10 - 15 mins (short) and read through the app and get an understanding of what is going on. 

Jot down 2 - 3 points that you like about it, or has been done well, and why

Jot down 2 - 3 points about what you would do to make the app better without adding any new features and why. 

## Part 2. 

Clone the repo, create a new branch. 

Implement 1 or more feature of your choice. Don't spend more than hour on it, and you don't need to finish the feature, 
just enough so that you think you have showed us what you can do. 

some suggestions include

- enable the ability to delete a todo (front end as well)
- create an admin user that can see all users todos 
- provide a search capability todo's

but you can do whatever you think provides value. 

You can submit a question as an issue on the github

once you have finished, submit a pull request.
